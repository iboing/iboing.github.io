## About Me

Currently, I am a Research Scientist in JD Explore Academy working with Prof. Dacheng Tao. Prior to that, I obtained my Ph.D. degree at Center for Data Science, Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies, Peking University, under the supervision of [Prof. Zhouchen Lin](https://zhouchenlin.github.io/). I received my bachelor's degree of applied physics from Nanjing University of Information Science & Technology in 2016.
